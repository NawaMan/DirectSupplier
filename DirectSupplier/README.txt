# DirectSupplier
Alternative utility dependency inject for Java.

Vision
For Java developers
who want to have dependency injection capability in their application
DirectSupplier provide such functionality
that let the developer request data, resources and/or implementations in
    which its actual realization does not need to be know at the request points
unlike other popular alternatives,
DirectSupplier allows much more flexibility in how to define the source
    and life-cycle of the realizations.
